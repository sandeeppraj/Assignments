	<h3 align="center">Programming languages</h3>
	A programming language is a formal computer language or constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.<br>

	<h3 align="center">C<sup>++</sup></h3>
	C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.

	<h3 align="center">C</h3>
	C - is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.

	<h3 align="center">Java</h3>
	Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[14] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[15] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[16] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

	<h3 align="center">O<sub>2</sub> and life</h3>
	The primary importance of oxygen is that it is critical for cellular respiration in all aerobic organisms. Oxygen also has medical uses including oxygen therapy, high-pressure treatment, and in protective suits made for space and deep sea exploration. Oxygen destroys harmful bacteria in human bodies, and is used to treat victims of carbon monoxide.
